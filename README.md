Case Study – London Pollution Project (Completed)

Objective: Analyzed real-world air pollution data across London to uncover patterns, hotspots, and trends using machine learning.
Project Goal: Built predictive models that forecasted pollution levels (NO₂, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀) based on traffic, weather, and location data from the London Air Quality Network.
Key Achievements:
Ingested and cleaned years of sensor data from 30+ monitoring sites.
Engineered features from traffic counts, wind speed, humidity, and time-of-day patterns.
Trained regression and time-series models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to predict hourly pollution spikes.

Focus: Mastered end-to-end data science on geospatial, time-stamped environmental data—because London’s air won’t clean itself.

Steps Completed:
🌍 Loaded and Explored London Air Quality Data
🛣️ Merged Traffic and Weather Datasets
📍 Mapped Pollution Hotspots with Geospatial Tools
🔧 Engineered Temporal and Seasonal Features
🤖 Trained Baseline Regression Models
⏳ Built LSTM for Time-Series Forecasting
⚙️ Tuned Hyperparameters and Validated Predictions
📊 Visualized Results and Policy Insights


Done with actual London sensor data—turned smog into stats, and proved ML can help clear the air (one prediction at a time). 🌫️→📈
